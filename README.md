# Power-BI--AtliQ-Grands-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing a dataset from AtliQ Grands, a prestigious five-star hotel group operating in India for over 20 years. Recently, the hotel chain has been experiencing a decline in market share and revenue. To address these challenges, their revenue team engaged in analyzing historical data to derive actionable insights.

## Dataset
The dataset covers a three-month period and includes information from 13,500 bookings. It encompasses various aspects of hotel operations and customer interactions.

## Power BI Report
I created a Power BI report consisting of six dashboards:

- **Summary Dashboard:** Displays key metrics and insights covering the entire dataset.
- **Property Performance Dashboard:** Analyzes individual property performance.
- **Acquisition Channels Dashboard:** Examines the effectiveness of different acquisition channels.
- **Room Categories Dashboard:** Focuses on performance across different room categories.
- **Time Period Dashboard:** Analyzes booking trends over different time periods.
- **City-Level Dashboard:** Provides insights into performance across various cities.
